Hello! For this project, I wanted to get data on the average reading score, basic achievement percentage and profiency percentage of each state in the U.S. from the Nation's Report Card. I first inspected the data and what it was housed in on the page (i.e. ids and classes). Through working with professor McAdams, it was determined that I would need to use selenium. So I installed selenium and developed a csv file. The driver function loads the driver and driver.get pulls the webpage, which is needed for selenium to work. Professor McAdams discovered time.sleep was needed to be set at 8 because it takes awhile for everything to load. From there, I identified the page, soup, table and rows. A for loop was used on the rows to find the data I was looking to scrape. Once the for-loop was completed, the driver quit and the csv closed.
